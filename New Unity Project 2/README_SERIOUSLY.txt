Awesome, you got the files!

First off, thank you for checking this out!

This is for testing purposes only, so beware of the bugs!  Also, the controls are super important, as there are really no prompts in the game for controls.  Please see further below for controls.


You have already unpacked the game, to play, just run the .exe!  But don't do it yet, read the rest of this first!


I would be extremely grateful if, after playing, if you have encountered any bugs, you could help me out by sending me a text file with the details of the bug.

The details include(but are not limited to):

Location when bug encountered (if applicable) examle: near planet, in ship, in abandoned station, etc.

System that you are using (mac, linux, windows, etc.)

Steps to replicate the bug, if possible

Percieved severity (did it crash, break something, falling forever?)






MAJOR KNOWN BUGS

After saving the game, if it is loaded, saving again will corrupt the file.

Buttons in some of the menus are cluttered/positioned incorrectly.

Enemy ships don't spawn, rendering Kill missions uncompletable.

When accessing a container, if you leave the container while not looking at it, the camera will lock in the up down rotation.

Collisions are not enabled between the ships and other objects, so you can currently fly through stations...

Audio lsiteners are currently enabled and disabled improperly, allowing you to hear things from the wrong positions.

There is some seriously unoptomized code in the station generation stuff, so when docking, prepare for framerate dips!

You can jump out of your ship into the nothingness of space, essentially dooming yourself.

There are some issues with Mission generation (like no flavour text, and automatically regenerating missions).




Controls (Super Important!)

While not actually a bug, when creating a new game, the name that you provide it will be what generates the universe, so you can test a few different names if you want to see the differences.

While not seated in the pilots seat of the ship, you will use WASD to move around and the mouse to look around.  

Menus that you see if 3d space, on walls, etc, will generally allow you to click on the buttons freely, but this can be a little weird as the camera will move as well.  To prevent this, walk up to the menu and press E to lock your camera on the current position, it allows you to interact with the menu more easily.

When inside of an Abandoned station, you will often see monsters.  They are attracted to your flashlights light, this can be toggled on and off with the F key, but beware, you won't know where you are in the dark!

When inside of an abandoned station you will come across many different containers that can be accessed with the E key.  A menu will pop up and you can transfer Items from the container(left side) to your inventory(right side).

Doors will open automagically.

Press the U key to immediately save the game!  Warning, don't do this with a save that has been loaded from a file, it's no good.

You can jump with the Spacebar!

To enter into the pilots seat of the main ship, walk up to it and press the E key.




While piloting the main ship:

WASD for forward, backward and strafing movement.  Mouse to rotate the ship, sorry, but I don't support inverting controls!

To change the acceleration speed of the ship, press O to decrease and press P to increase,  this is useful for going in for docking (slow) and for moving to the next star(fast).

Press F to completely stop the ship(fun fact, this also toggles your flashlight!!!).

Press T to teleport around the current system, beware of positional bugs!  This is a debug/testing only function, so, you know, yeah.

If you press the shift key, you can look at the Navigation menu.  Just click on the button to have a marker show up to guide you to that destination!  Pressing shift again will reset the camera!

When close to a station, press the G key to initiate docking.  This will remove control from you and autodock the ship.

After docking, you can undock with the G key as well.

While really close to an asteroid in an asteroid field, press the B key to deploy a mining drone to go and mine some ore for you.  It will give you one ore every ten seconds.  To retrieve the drone, press the N key.

When you are tired of flying the ship or if you just want to stretch your legs, press the R key to get up and walk around.

Fighter ship:

The little blue ship in your storage bay is your fighter ship.

To enter the fighter ship, walk up to it and press the E key.  

While in the ship, press the T key to lower yourself out of the storage bay.  Once lowered, you will gain control over the fighter ship similar to the Main ship controls.

To redock with the main ship, fly into the center of the docking bay and press the T key, this will remove control from you and initiate the redocking.

To exit the fighter ship, be docked and press the R key.
